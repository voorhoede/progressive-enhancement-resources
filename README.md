## The Concept

[Progressive Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) means gradually improving the user experience after verifying the target environment (e.g. browser) is capable of it. Start with content and ensure you maintain functionality & accessibility.

* [Progressive Enhancement: It's about the content](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/progressive-enhancement-its-about-the-content) - Sharing content is the core of the web. Progressive Enhancement ensures access to content.
* [The Role of Enhancement in Web Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/enhancement/) - From the concept of enhancement to the criteria and rules for enriching the user interface.
* [Understanding Progressive Enhancement](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement) - Apply technologies in an intelligent way, layer-upon-layer, to craft an amazing experience.
* [Designing with Progressive Enhancement](https://www.filamentgroup.com/dwpe/) - *The book* (400+ pages) on Progressive Enhancement.
* [Adaptive Web Design](http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/) - Book on Progressive Enhancement from content to design and interaction.
* [Detecting (HTML5) features](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/detect.html) - Intro to different feature detection techniques with examples and demos. 
* [Progressive Web Apps](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/) - Enhancing web sites into native-like apps (progressive, not hybrid).


## Strategies

You can apply Progressive Enhancement in different ways:

* [The Content-out Approach](https://articles.uie.com/progressive_enhancement/) - Provide wide access to content without technological restrictions.
* [Make the page usable with only HTML](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement#make-the-page-usable-with-only-html) - This sets the baseline for every device and browser.
* [Test Driven Progressive Enhancement](http://alistapart.com/article/testdriven) - Core functional experience enhanced after testing capabilities.
* [Cut the mustard](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard) - Set a threshold for collection of enhancements.
* [Grade components, not browsers](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html
) - Component level feature tests and enhancements.
* [Feature vs Browser vs Form factor detection](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/detection/) - As different strategies to tune your app to its environment.
* [Server-side device detection](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/server-side-device-detection-with-javascript/) - Use user-agent and other HTTP header info combined with a device database to conditionally serve files.
* [Writing polyfills](https://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-polyfills/) - If your baseline is still too high for some browsers, consider [polyfills](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill) (aka [Regressive Enhancement](https://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/25600963629)).
* [Application Shell Architecture](https://medium.com/google-developers/instant-loading-web-apps-with-an-application-shell-architecture-7c0c2f10c73) - Setup for instant loading web apps.


## Feature Detection

Before you try to enhance the experience, you need to ensure the environment is capable of the enhancement. You test this by performing feature detections:

* [CSS feature queries](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-css-supports-rule-feature-queries/) ([`CSS.supports()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/CSS/supports) & [`@supports()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports)) - Natively test if specific CSS feature is supported using JS method or CSS declaration.
* [Feature Detect ES6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feature-detect-es6) - Detect which ES2015 features are available.
* [SVG requiredFeatures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/requiredFeatures) - Render SVG elements only if their `[requiredFeatures]` evaluate to true.
* [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) - Extensive feature detection suite (supports custom builds).
* [Feature.js](http://featurejs.com/) - Lightweight feature detection suite.
* [Conditioner.js](http://conditionerjs.com/) - Conditionally load JS modules based on directives in HTML attributes.
* [EnhanceJS](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/introducing-enhancejs-smarter-safer-apply-progressive-enhancement.html) - Lets you asynchronously load CSS & JS after a set pre-defined feature tests.


## Support Tables
